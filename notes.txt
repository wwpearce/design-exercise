Hi Pratik (or whomever)! Just wanted to write some notes about my process as I
went along.

- I'm using `create-react-app` to bootstrap the React app. When I'm wearing my
prototyper hat, I'll leverage this (along with any other clean libraries) to
move as quickly as possible. I noticed that the instructions said not to use any
kind of CSS bootstrapping so I'll abstain on that for now. But just a note that
in my day to day, if it saves me time and is clean, I'm using it :D
