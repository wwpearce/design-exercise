Hi Pratik (or whomever)! Just wanted to write some notes about my process as I
went along.

- I commented wherever necessary (and probably some less than necessary)
- I'm using `create-react-app` to bootstrap the React app. When I'm wearing my
prototyper hat, I'll leverage this (along with any other clean libraries) to
move as quickly as possible. I noticed that the instructions said not to use any
kind of CSS bootstrapping so I'll abstain on that for now. But just a note that
in my day to day, if it saves me time and is clean, I'm using it :D
- I ran out of time and did not have time to built the input text box correctly.
It still functions, but it's value is hard-coded and therefore you cannot type
a new date into it.
- I built the rudiments of the functionality to flip through months, but it's shaky
at best so I left it out of the master branch. There's a branch called `month-changes`
that I'll try to keep fresh should you choose to use it.
- I'm not sure what the changes were for the 320px mobile layout; they didn't make
sense to me, so omitting.
- In retrospect, a time / date library like moment.js would probably been handy,
but I wanted to keep this close to vanilla.js so you could see my thought process.

That's it for now. Please reach out if you have questions!
