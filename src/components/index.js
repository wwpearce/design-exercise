                &#8230;and I'm assuming you're a technical director, or a creative director, or somebody who needs a website; you know, that type of thing. You're probably looking for a designer or a developer or both or better yet, you just read an article on Creative Technologists and Google brought you here. Which brings us to what may be your first question&#8230;
              </p>
              <h2 class="wtf">WTF is a creative technologist???</h2>
              <p>It's me! I'm a Creative Technologist! I am a creative thinker from a technical POV. Equally adept at the creative and production phases of a project, I can dream up a product or campaign, put together a prototype, run a UX study, iterate on designs, and write production quality webcode all by my lonesome. I'm comfortable in all roles along the production timeline, from UX to Art Director to Front-End Developer. Most of my experience has been in advertising, but I've spent some time at a big tech company too. Here’s a link to my <a href="assets/docs/resume_bill-pearce.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

            <p>
              I'm client friendly and I've spoken at a few conferences. Here's video of two of my talks: <a target="_blank" href="assets/media/about/videos/wdc2018-ux.mp4">Guerilla-Style User Research</a> & <a target="_blank" href="assets/media/about/videos/dtsummit2017-alexa.mp4">Thou Shalt Not Skill Without a Build Process</a>. If you're not sick of the sound of my voice yet, here's a few videos of me explaining some IoT projects I've done (I swear these were for work): <a target="_blank" href="assets/media/about/videos/ABC Prototype - Dr Pepper_1.mp4">Arduino Beverage Coozy</a> & <a target="_blank" href="assets/media/about/videos/Bill_FoodButton.mp4">The Office Food Button</a>.
              <br /><br />
              I also have a few side-businesses in which I design and illustrate logos (there's a few in the work section) and teach <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thunderstrikethaiboxing/">Thai boxing</a>.
              <br /><br />
